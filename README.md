# README.md

A small experiment. I guess there are loads of markdown enabled sites, etc. But I wanted a small self contained server that just does markdown serving, when called.

    # go run main.go

Then browse the following `http://localhost:3002/example.md`. You should be able to see the example rendered in html with the default css.
